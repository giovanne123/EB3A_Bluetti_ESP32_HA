# EB3A_Bluetti_ESP32_HA
Interface between Bluetti-EB3A and HA by using a ESP32 with Bluetooth and MQTT
Extended with focus to EB3A
- Servo attached to ESP32 for switching on the EB3A if BLE is powered down by the EB3A (called by MQTT or fallback HTTP)
- HA Discovery config is send to MQTT by external python script and config in file (modifications possible without recompile/reflash)
- Set Connected Status to MQTT for using in HA
- More functions for EB3A possible (LED, ECO_MODE, ...) !But lot's "Quick&Dirty"!
- No auto Reboot ESP32 if Bluetooth is not connected, because EB3A switch Bluetooth off after ~1h (when nothing is active)
  Therefore is the Servo to switch on again and also power consumption can be optimized when Bluetooth is not all the time on on EB3A
(- controlling will be done in HA by Automations, ...)

<b>!!! Lot's is Quick&Dirty because needed the EB3A running for Solar over-production redirection ;-) !!!</b>

Todo:
- Remove Quick&Dirty ;-)
- for state-topic for some entities (e.g. LED_MODE, CHARGING_MODE, ...) currently the command-topic is used until state can be read from the EB3A
- ...

(Have put everything in new repository because too much implemented Quick & Dirty for EB3A)

## About
This is an ESP32 based Bluetooth to MQTT Bride for BLUETTI power stations. The project is based on https://github.com/warhammerkid/bluetti_mqtt
The code is tested on a AC300. Other Powerstations should also work but are untested yet. The discussion on https://diysolarforum.com/threads/monitoring-bluetti-systems.37870/ was a great help for understanding the protocol.

## Getting Started

### Compiling and Flashing to ESP32

#### Arduino IDE

You will need to install a board support package for your ESP32. Additionally the following libraries are needed: 

* https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager
* https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient
* https://github.com/ayushsharma82/AsyncElegantOTA
* https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer
* https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP/archive

Change the partition scheme with Tools -> Partition Scheme to

* Minimal SPIFFS (1.9 MB App with OTA/ 190KB SPIFFS)

![Wifi Manager start menu](doc/images/partition.png)

This setting is required because the Bluetooth stack already uses a lot of the ESP32 memory.

Optional: Do changes in config.h file. The device can be set by changing 'BLUETTI_TYPE'.

Finally upload the Sketch to your ESP32.

*INFO*: Until now only BLUETTI_AC300, BLUETTI_EP500P was tested. If you own one of the supported devices please let me know if it works.

#### PlatformIO

Compiling
```
$ pio run
```

Flashing Factory Image
```
$ esptool.py write_flash 0x0 build/Bluetti_ESP32_Bridge.factory.bin
```

Updating only App (don't delete settings)
```
# Write Partition A
$ esptool.py write_flash 0x10000 build/Bluetti_ESP32_Bridge.ota.bin
...
# Write Partition B
$ esptool.py write_flash 0x1F0000 build/Bluetti_ESP32_Bridge.ota.bin
```

The configuration interface also offers OTA updates. You can flash also `build/Bluetti_ESP32_Bridge.ota.bin` there. If you already configured your device you can use `http://<ip_address/update` to update your firmware (no-reconfiguration needed)

### Usage

Just connect the ESP32 to a power supply or the power station itself. Connect your mobile phone or computer
to the Wifi mangaer of the ESP32 firmware, it should show up as "ESP32_Bluetti".

After the connection to the hotspot is established a wifi manager popup will appear. Otherwise
open 192.168.4.1 in your local webbrowser.

Select "Configure WiFi"

![Wifi Manager start menu](doc/images/wifi_manager.png)

Configure your WiFi and set the address of your MQTT server and enter the Bluetooth ID of your
Bluetti Device. Optionally you can specify username and password to protect the web OTA interface.
You can use a mobile phone and/or the Bluetti APP for finding the correct Bluetooth ID of your device.

![Wifi Manager start menu](doc/images/wifi_setup.png)

Save the settings. The ESP32 starts sending messages to your MQTT server.

Example ( ioBroker ):

### MQTT Topics

#### Commands
Commands are subscribed from

* /bluetti/<your_device_id>/command
  * ac_output_on
  * dc_output_on

#### State
States are published to
* /bluetti/<your_device_id>/state
  * ac_output_on

## TODO

* add full feature set to device files
* adding support for OLED display
* adding support for SD-Card reader, for writing csv data to an sd-card
* adding logging poll commands
